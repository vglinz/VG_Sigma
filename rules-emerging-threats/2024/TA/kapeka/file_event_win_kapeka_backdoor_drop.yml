title: Suspicious Backdoor Dropped by Kapeka Loader
id: 4fd6a3d8-812a-4b5f-af7c-e2910cfb8f0d
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects the presence of the decrypted backdoor binary dropped by the Kapeka Dropper,
  which disguises itself as a hidden file under a folder named "Microsoft" within CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA or CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA, depending on the process privileges.
  The file, typically 5-6 characters long with a random combination of consonants and vowels followed by a ".wll" extension,
  poses as a legitimate word to evade detection.
